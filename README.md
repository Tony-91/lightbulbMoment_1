# What i learned from a simple addition function in Javascript  

- A function that adds numbers together. We prompt the user for n amount of inputs. While num is a number, run code block, otherwise stop while loop. While num is either ‘q’ or ‘Q’, stop the while loop. 

- I learned the importance of “starting from 0”, makes code more dynamical - changes over time. Rather than hard coding numbers. Maybe that’s a good tip: no hard coding, always use variables when possible. Punch holes or leave room for values. 

- let variable changes over the course of the function, its just our starting point we have to hard or statically code. const is dynamic / hard code that will not change over the course of the code.

- Variables and “setting them to 0 or null” & Parameters help use create dynamic code.

*In programming, the terms "dynamic" and "static" refer to the way code behaves at runtime.
Static code is code that does not change during runtime. It is written in a way that the structure and behavior of the program is determined before it is executed. The structure of the code is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime.
On the other hand, Dynamic code is code that can change during runtime. The structure and behavior of the program is determined at runtime and it can change based on input or other conditions. It allows for more flexibility in how the program behaves, but it can also make the code more complex.*

*In JavaScript, variables are often used to make code dynamic. A variable can hold different values at different times, which allows the code to change based on user input or other conditions. For example, a variable can be used to store the result of a user's input, and that result can then be used to determine the behavior of the program.*
